# progressive-web-application-assignment

The goal of this assignment was to use starter code provided to complete a text editor app that uses webpack and can be downloaded to a user's device.

First, I added the build and dev scripts to the package.json to allow the client and server to run sepeartely and effectively.

Next, I completed the code for the webpack, service worker, database caching, and installing the app using the provided starter code.

Finally, I used the json scripts to build the app and utilized webpack to ensure it met PWA standards, and deployed the app to Heroku.

The deployed app on heroku can be found here: https://brians-jate-text-editor.herokuapp.com/

A screenshot of the functional app is provided below:
